# 🫀 Heart Stroke Risk Prediction

This repository contains a **Machine Learning project** that predicts the risk of heart stroke based on medical and lifestyle data.  
The goal is to assist in **early risk identification** and support decision-making for healthcare.  

## 🌐 Live Demo
👉 [Visit Project Website](https://shobhitdahiya.github.io/Heart-Stroke-Prediction/)  

## ✨ Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data, scaling)  
- Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  
- Interactive web interface for predictions  
- Deployed with GitHub Pages  

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses the **Heart Stroke Dataset** (from Kaggle / WHO dataset).  
Features include:  
- Age, Gender, Hypertension, Heart Disease, Smoking Status, etc.  
- Target variable: `stroke` (1 = stroke, 0 = no stroke)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (for UI)  
- GitHub Pages (for deployment)  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shobhitdahiya/Heart-Stroke-Prediction.git
Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Jupyter Notebook or Flask app to test predictions.
